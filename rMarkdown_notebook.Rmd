First we load the libraries and data. For this example I will just be using data from the Lahman baseball package but you can just as easily load local files or do some web scraping etc.

I will be using several htmlWidgets for speed rather than shiny runtime - though that is entirely possible and I have used for most of my Apps

```{r setup, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


# Data manipulation and static graphing
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

# htmlWidgets
library(plotly) # interactive charts
library(DT)     # sophisticated tables
library(leaflet) # mapping
library(crosstalk) # interactivity between widgets 

# data
library(Lahman)
```

### Batting leader by season

This example is a, slightly amended, vignette example replicating a NYT chart

```{r}

# data carpentry

masterInfo <- Master %>%
  select(playerID, birthYear, birthMonth, nameLast,
         nameFirst, bats,birthCountry,birthState,birthCity,debut) 

batting <- battingStats() %>% 
  left_join(masterInfo, by = "playerID") %>%
  mutate(age = yearID - birthYear - 
           1L *(birthMonth >= 10)) %>%
  arrange(playerID, yearID, stint)

eligibleHitters <- batting %>%
  filter(yearID >= 1900 & PA > 450)

topHitters <- eligibleHitters %>%
  group_by(yearID) %>%
  filter(BA == max(BA)| BA >= .400) %>%
  mutate(ba400 = BA >= 0.400) %>%
  mutate(name=paste0(nameFirst," ",nameLast)) %>% 
  select(playerID, yearID, name, 
         BA, ba400)


# initial plot

topHitters %>%
  plot_ly(x=~yearID,y=~BA)

# production(ish) chart

topHitters %>% 
  plot_ly(x=~yearID,y=~BA, color=~name, hoverinfo = "text",
text = ~ paste(name,
               "<br>Year: ",yearID,
               "<br>BA: ",BA)) %>%
  layout(hovermode = "closest",
        # height = 400,
       #  autosize = F,
         title="The Last to Hit .400?",
         xaxis=list(title="Season"),
         yaxis=list(title="Batting Average" ))  %>% 
  config(displayModeBar = F,showLink = F)
